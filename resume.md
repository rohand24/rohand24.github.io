## Translational Research & Product Development

### Georgia Institute of Technology & Emory University - Dept. of Biomedical Engineering
Graduate Researcher | Atlanta, GA | 2022 - Present

**Project:** ARiSe / CARE-CKD - Retinal AI for Cardiovascular Screening in CKD

**Problem:** Cardiovascular disease (CVD) screening is often costly and inaccessible in non-specialist and resource-limited settings.

**Innovation:** Designed a "frugal AI" pipeline (ARiSe) that repurposes routine, low-cost retinal fundus images to predict CVD risk; clinically evaluated in CKD patients as CARE-CKD.

**Clinical & Translational Traction**
Validated on 800 CKD patients; results published in Kidney360 (CARE-CKD study) using real-world clinical data.

Retinal feature pipeline additionally demonstrated utility for Alzheimer's disease detection, highlighting cross-disease applicability.

Featured in Emory Health Digest (Summer 2025) as a case study in equitable diagnostics.

Secured GRA Phase 1 commercialization funding to develop a deployable retinal risk assessment prototype for optometry and nephrology clinic workflows.

**Project:** Non-Invasive Transplant Rejection Monitoring (ECG-based)

**Problem:** Heart transplant recipients undergo frequent, invasive endomyocardial biopsies to monitor rejection.

**Innovation:** Developing an AI-based ECG analysis tool to estimate rejection risk non-invasively and reduce reliance on biopsies.

**Clinical Traction**
Preliminary validation accepted for presentation at ISHLT 2026.

Ongoing work with clinical collaborators to integrate the model into standard post-transplant follow-up workflows.

### Center for Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics (CCIPD), Case Western Reserve University
Research Assistant | Cleveland, OH | 2020 - 2022

**Project:** Opportunistic Liver Screening (DeHFT / LARI)

**Innovation:** Co-invented a deep learning system to assess hepatic steatosis from low-dose CT scans originally acquired for coronary calcium scoring (opportunistic screening).

**Clinical & Translational Traction**
Validated on 700 patients with strong correlation to reference standards.

Underpins an allowed US patent on hepatic fat assessment.

Extended in the LARI study, published in Lancet eBioMedicine, demonstrating opportunistic liver fat quantification at scale and supporting future licensing/translation opportunities.
