		<h2>From research to deployment</h2>
		<p>
			I have helped advance AI-driven diagnostics toward clinical use through commercialization
			funding, intellectual property filings, and clinical validation in cohorts spanning
			cardiology, nephrology, and hepatology. Current efforts focus on building deployable
			prototypes for optometry and specialty clinic workflows.
